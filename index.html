                <p>A little about me — I was born and raised in Texas, but at 18 years old, I took a chance and moved to New York City for college. That decision led me through 4 years of school, and 9 more years building my career. I graduated from New York University and believed that I would never return to Texas. 
                <p>It turns out, I was wrong. In 2016, I was offered a chance to come back to my home state and work on a new product. I jumped at the chance. As I progressed through my career, one consistent theme kept popping up — help people transition from one phase of their life to another. It doesn't matter in what capacity I use my skills, I want to continue helping people. Now, I'm a 
                    Software Developer. I reached a point in my life where I want to build things that help people. I'm living and working in Austin, Texas with my wife, daughter, and bulldog Mabel. Always striving to help people in whatever way I can.
